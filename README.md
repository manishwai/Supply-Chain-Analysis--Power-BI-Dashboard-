# Supply-Chain-Analysis--Power-BI-Dashboard-
Problem Statment 
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.
AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.
The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

MAY'22 and AUG'22 are the two months where IF% and OTIF 9%have shown slight improvement compare to past month, still they are far away from Target levels
In Daily Trend for OT% Graphs for Order even Daily level of OT% too are significantly lower than Targeted OT%
As we see in above slide only 59.03% of total orders are delivered on time
Even Daily trends of IF% and OTIF % chartshows that not a single day they are able totouch the Target lines for respective matrices.Especially OTIF% performance is quitedisappointing.
